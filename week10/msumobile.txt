The MSU mobile website is very compatible with the iPhone, and is very functional. However, it is a lot harder to navigate and find what you are looking for when you enter the website. The sorting of the mobile website is too complex with few categories in comparison to the amount of information the website provides. The organization of the website is not very user friendly in terms of finding specific content. 
The positive thing about this mobile website is that the tabs that are available on the homepage are the most important/meaningful ones, because when people sign into the mobile they are looking for one or two things and they are probably the ones that are listed on the homepage.
