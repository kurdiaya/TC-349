 Critique of United Pixelworkers:

I don't know if I really like the setup of this website. Being on this website for the first time I can tell it's a e-commerce website and they
are obviously selling a t-shirt, however it is unclear to me what other products they are selling, and who they are offering it to (targeting). I would
recommend a new homepage design with an introduction of their brand with a better navigation that helps you navigate through the website and find exactly what
you are looking for/ discover what this website is all about. 

During the fifth week of this course, we learned a helpful technique called card sorting, which could be very useful technique specifically in this website's case, as it is very unorganized. I feel like everything they have is all over the place and it needs to be more sorted out/organized. I feel like they wanted to offer everything they had on the homepage and did that purposely, but personally I don't really like to shop using websites like that because I feel overwhelmed as it is too chaotic. OTher than the layout of this website I really like everything else, I think the text font suit the style very well, I like the color scheme used. The website is very fast and loads very well, once you click on an item to buy I really like the checkout process.

Overall I think its a good website, specially after you click around and scope the website. My only complaint would be that it should be more organized and have a better homepage/inventory setup.
