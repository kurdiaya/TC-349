I've had to use Vimeo for one of my classes a few years back, and never really used it besides then. Revisiting the website now, the upgrades they added to their website look absolutely amazing! The layout is well organized and easy to navigate through. It is also very appealing with an amazing background illustration that immediately grabs your attention. At the same time, they used very subtle and warm colors that gives a great feel to the website, making it very welcoming and inviting. 

As you scroll down, the website provides you with everything you can do that you can do on Vimeo in a very organized way. The listings include a title, a brief description and a picture that you can click on to learn more about it in detail. This is very helpful especially to someone who is not very tech savvy and needs instructions on how to use the website and make the most out of it on his/her own without getting frustrated. Whether you are creating,uploading, or watching a video, the website provides clear steps that help anyone who's interested. 

My only complaints about the website are concerning the layouts of the navigation bars. For the top navigation bar, I would prefer the option to click on the button and have it open up a new window with the sub-navigation options as oppose to a scroll down. However, I would still like to see a scroll down option only if you drag your mouse on top of the button as oppose to clicking it. Also once you've clicked on the buttons, I would've like a right-side navigation similar to the one on YouTube as oppose to the one they currently have. I don't know if it's because I'm used to YouTube layout so much or because it's actually easier to search videos that way! But otherwise they have done a great job with the new version of their website! Very creative and appealing!
