	<h1> A Short Critique </h1>
	<h2> Panic.com is a website that develops apps for Macs, iPhones, and iPads. When you enter the website, they welcome you with a short greeting to let you know who they are, and the purpose behind their website. Following that there are icons of each of the apps that they've developed and is available for public use. I really like the simplicity of this website as it is very straight to the point. I feel like not  anyone would go on the website, but it is only targeted for specific people who know the product they want or the service they're looking for and find this website. It is very easy to navigate through, and towards the end of the website there is a help box where you are able to get assistance from them, if you were to acquire it. I really like the vibe they are going for in this website, it is very light and humorous.
