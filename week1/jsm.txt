http://jasonsantamaria.com/ is a website developed and founded by Jason Santa Maria, a graphic designer living in New York. I really like the layout of this website. I like how the horizontal lines separate each article or topic that has posted. I also like how even though each topic is on its separate row, they all seem in harmony with each other. This is because each of the dates, title, and preview for the articles/videos/topics posted are under each other. 
The first thing that catches your eye are the titles of each topic. This is because they are all bold to highlight them and make them stand out as oppose to anything else on the website. The thing that bothers me about this website, as many others is that there is no button on the right side that takes you back to the top, thus you have to scroll back up when your down to the end of the page. Other than that, I like the color scheme, I think mixing black, white and red is working very well with the layout. I like how he has incorporated lines throughout the website and has even created shapes at the end that blend very well although having different content.
