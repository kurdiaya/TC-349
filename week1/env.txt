Although I'm pretty familiar with Dreamweaver, I decided to explore different environments for developing websites. After looking at some text editors, I decided to go with TextMate. The main reason I chose TextMate was because in one of your videos you recommended that we do use it. Also because you are using it in your tutorials, it would give me the ability to compare the way my code looks like as oppose to how it should be, enabling me to self check my errors and correct them. Furthermore, I have opened it up and played around for a while and found it easy to navigate around. Using dreamweaver, I would be worried to accidentally use their ready made code instead of create my own. 
Another interesting feature about TextMate is its ability to connect to Github! once I get used to using both Github and TextMate, I might try to connect Github to TextMate so that I can directly add my repositories on Github without using the terminal. (I'm not sure if thats actually possible, but thats what I read/understood)
