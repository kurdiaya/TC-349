<h2>Educational Information </h2>
<p>Here is a little background information on my education! I attended the <a href="http://www.abs.edu.jo">Amman Baccalaureate School</a> located in Amman, Jordan. I graduated with an IB Diploma since the high school I attended had a British system that stands for International Baccalaureate. We had to take six classes, three were mandatory while the other three were optional. The classes that I took are as follow: English, Arabic, Math,(mandatory) Biology, Islamic History, and Economics (optional).</p>
<p>After graduating High school in Jordan, I decided I wanted to continue my education somewhere else and that's when I moved to Michigan at the age of 17 to attend <a href="http://www.msu.edu/" target="_blank">Michigan State University </a> that is located in East Lansing, Michigan. It was a very random choice, and until this day I don't really have an answer to the very common question "Why did you choose Michigan State?". I am currently a Senior with a Bachelor of Science in Media and Information. My concentration is in Web Development and Game Design. Hopefully, after I graduate I'll be able to find a job in either New York City or San Francisco, as I would really love to live there for a while.</p>
