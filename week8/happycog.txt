There are several things that stood out to me while exploring this website. The first thing I really liked was the font! I actually enjoyed reading the website because of the font and the size and color they decided to use. The second thing I liked was the simple color scheme. Even though the background color is white, they still managed to keep their website very vibrant and appealling. Finally, the thing that stood out to me the most was the flow of the website. 

There are six main sections presented on the website, all which are available on the main page. As you scroll down, you can view each section which had a title, brief description, photos, and a button that allows you to expand for more information. The great thing about the website was the horizontal navigation bar at the top of the page, that can direct you to each section automatically so that you don't have to scroll down, however, if you do  decide to scroll down, the navigation bar would still be at the top of the page for your convenience. In the middle of the navigation bar, they have placed their logo button which functions as a back to the top of the page. I really liked the layout and the style of the website and thought it was very creative and unusual, as well as practical and functional!
