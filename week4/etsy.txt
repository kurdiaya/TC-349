	Personally, I love Etsy! I always like to shop from their website. Satisfied as a customer I always go back to the website to shop for more. Being an online shopper, I usually choose the websites according to two things: price, and website usability. The more user friendly and easy to navigate around a website is, the more I'm likely to go back and shop from that website. 

	That Being said, Etsy is one of the many websites that I have come back to, to buy more stuff from. I love the whole idea of handmade vintage items being sold on one website, I also like the idea that you can contact and message the seller asking them questions and conversing with them about the item they have before actually buying it. 
	
	The two concerns I have with Etsy, first, although you can write a review about the seller himself, it would be nice if you are able to review the product itself. The second concern is that I feel like Etsy is setup more as a view it website more than an online store website. I see myself surfing around Etsy looking for cool things people post as oppose to finding a product that interests me or I'd want to buy.
