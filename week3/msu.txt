When you first take a glimpse of Michigan State University's website homepage, you will find that it is aesthetically pleasing to look at. It is very effectively organized in a way that is soothing to your eyes, even when it has a lot of information to offer. When you start navigating through the website you will realize that you can find everything you are looking for as everything on the website is labelled and is a part of an easy to use layout.

The website uses the official MSU colors: white and green which gives Spartan fans who check out the website a sense of belonging. With a white background, it allows the user to easily read without getting a headache. And the different shades of green add enough richness to the website without making it seem too dull or too lively. In the center of the website, there is a slideshow displaying the university's latest achievements, which focuses the user on the best of what MSU has to offer.
